To install follow link to my git repo and click the green clone or download
button to install on your PC

If you don't already have them installed you will need **Node and NPM** you can do that through brew or through their web sites [Node.js(https://nodejs.org/en/)and NPM((https://www.npmjs.com))]

In your command line change your directory to **URL_Shortener** and then **npm install** this should install all dependencies in the **package.json** file into your directory.

Still in your command line type and still in your directory URL_Shortener type
**node src/server**üëçüèª it should say 'Good to go on port 300'.

Now you need to use "postman"(https://www.getpostman.com/) once thats loaded change your drop down arrow next to the search style bar, change it to get and than type in **localhost:3000/api/v1.0/url** inside of your search style bar and hit send. You should see something like this **{
  "URL": "http://achme.comb6f8c0du"
